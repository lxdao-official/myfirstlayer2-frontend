    "impossibleTriangle-content-5": "The pursuit of high scalability (performance) and decentralization often involves the implementation of numerous verification nodes to strengthen decentralization. To improve performance, strategies such as accelerating block generation speed or adopting unique consensus mechanisms are employed. However, accelerating block generation can inadvertently trigger extensive block reorganizations. Similarly, more complex consensus mechanisms can lead to network-wide outages and other security breaches, thus compromising security. ",
    "impossibleTriangle-content-6": "Representative blockchains: In 2023, Polygon experienced a significant reorganization of 157 blocks. Within its first two years of operation, Solana encountered eight network-wide outages.",
    "impossibleTriangle-content-7": "The pursuit of high security and scalability (performance) often involves relying on a limited number of super nodes for communication. These super nodes possess superior performance and optimal network conditions, enabling ultra-fast communication among themselves. However, this approach compromises the level of decentralization due to the high entry threshold.",
    "impossibleTriangle-content-8": "Representative blockchains: BSC, EOS, and TRON operate using a network maintained by only 21 high-performance nodes.",
    "impossibleTriangle-content-9": "The pursuit of high decentralization and security often involves the utilization of a larger number of nodes and fairer methods of block generation that are considered trustworthy. However, accommodating lower-performance nodes in the verification process and managing global network latency can reduce the number of transactions processable per second, thereby compromising performance.",
    "impossibleTriangle-content-10": "Representative blockchains: BTC and ETH prioritize exceptional security and decentralization. However, this comes at the cost of slower transaction processing speeds, with BTC handling approximately 7 transactions per second and ETH processing between 10 and 20 transactions per second.",
