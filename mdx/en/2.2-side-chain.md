# 2.2 Sidechain

To overcome state channels' limitations in **handling complex transactions**, Sidechain solutions have come to prominence.

Sidechains can be viewed as relatively independent blockchains, often adopting architectures akin to the main chain, like Ethereum, simplifying the migration of main chain projects to sidechains.

By locking a specific asset amount in the main chain's smart contracts, an equivalent asset amount can be minted on the sidechain, achieving "atomic swaps". By depositing assets into the sidechain, different transactions can be performed there, then moved back to the main chain when necessary.

Sidechains undergo customizations to boost performance and alleviate transaction load on the main chain.

-   Adopting the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, sidechains notably enhance block creation speed, thereby achieving scalability. For instance, the Polygon sidechain has decreased block time to 2 seconds.
-   Employing the Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, sidechains can achieve ultra-high performance with fewer authorized super nodes for communication. An example is the Ronin sidechain, which enables game asset transactions. Given the more centralized nature of NFT assets within games, this approach is acceptable.

There is a debate over whether sidechains should be classified as Layer 2 since they are affected by the main chain but **do not inherit its security level**.

Sidechain security is contingent on their own consensus nodes' integrity. Consequently, the sidechain itself and the bridge between the sidechain and the main chain may encounter security issues. Following the "weakest link" principle, security hinges on the system's most vulnerable point. If a sidechain runs into problems, it can compromise the overall security of the ecosystem.
