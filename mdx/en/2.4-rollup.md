# 2.4 Rollup

While Plasma may not have achieved widespread acceptance, certain elements of its principles were retained and furthered in subsequent Layer 2 solutions.

Given that the key challenge with Plasma centered on **data availability**, particularly the obstacles faced by auditors in accessing transaction data for verification, what if we not only uploaded a root proof but also incorporated all essential transaction data to Layer 1? Could this offer a viable solution to the problem?

This train of thought brought about what is currently the most practical Layer 2 scaling solution: Rollup. The term "Rollup" refers to the bundling process where transactions over a certain period are consolidated, packaged, and periodically uploaded to the mainnet. At present, mainstream Rollup solutions can be broadly divided into two categories: Optimistic Rollup and Zero-knowledge Rollup.

- Optimistic Rollup: Optimistic Rollup, or OP-Rollup, aggregates and bundles all transaction details occurring within a given timeframe and periodically dispatches them to Layer 1. This mechanism optimistically assumes that the majority of transactions are honest and it borrows the challenge period and fraud proof mechanisms from Plasma.

- Zero-knowledge Rollup: Zero-knowledge Rollup, or ZK-Rollup, usually computes the results of transactions over a specific period, consolidates and bundles the state changes, and attaches a zero-knowledge proof that validates the correct execution of the transactions on Layer 2. It then periodically dispatches these bundles to Layer 1. Zero-knowledge proofs are employed instead of auditors, relying on mathematics rather than validators.

While Rollup's Layer 2 solution slightly compromises decentralization, it delivers the following benefits:

- Significantly lightens the computational load on Layer 1, effectively achieving scalability.
- Compresses transaction data, conserving storage resources on Layer 1.
- Uploads crucial information to Layer 1, where Layer 1 holds the final adjudication authority over Layer 2, thus maximizing the inheritance of Layer 1 security.

To relieve Layer 1's load as much as possible, **compression is crucial**. So, how does this compression process operate?
