# 3.4 Zero-Knowledge Rollup

The reason for OP-Rollup's extensive waiting period lies in its reliance on human involvement, specifically in the form of challengers. Ideally, the entire process should be automated, with algorithmic participation supplanting human intervention.

Is there a potent algorithm allowing honest transaction validators in Layer 2 to generate a proof that dishonest validators can't obtain, and which can be verified in Layer 1 at a significantly low cost?

Such an algorithm would enable Layer 1 to confirm a whole batch of transactions as legitimate once it validates the proof. If the proof fails, the entire batch can be rejected. This sounds almost too ideal, but does such technology exist?

Fortunately, such proofs do exist in the mathematical realm, known as zero-knowledge proofs.

## What is a Zero-Knowledge Proof?

A zero-knowledge proof is a method for proving to another party that a given statement is true without divulging any additional information beyond the fact of its truth. For instance, consider a circular corridor with a password-protected door somewhere in the middle. To prove to B that they know the door's password, A can simply enter the corridor from the entrance and exit from the other side, demonstrating to B that they know the password without revealing the actual password.

Zero-knowledge proofs exhibit the following traits:

1. Completeness: If a proposition is true, any prover can convince the verifier of its truth, i.e., "true statements are verifiable."
2. Soundness: If a proposition is false, no dishonest prover can trick the verifier, i.e., "false statements will be detected."
3. Zero-knowledge: Proving a proposition true doesn't reveal any extra information beyond its truth.

In practical engineering, zero-knowledge proof algorithms should also possess the following properties:

1. Succinctness <sup>[1]</sup> : The proofs are small and can be verified swiftly.
2. Zero knowledge: They conceal the computation's input information.

## Zero-Knowledge Rollup

By employing these magical zero-knowledge proofs, we can minimize the data uploaded to Layer 1, thus enhancing scalability.

ZK-Rollup regularly uploads three types of data to the mainnet:

-   State root: The state root swiftly verifies whether the Layer 2 mini-ledger's content has been tampered with.
-   Transaction data: Compressed and aggregated transaction data, such as the batched state change outcomes of multiple transactions. With zero-knowledge proofs ensuring
-   Validity proofs: These are zero-knowledge proofs that allow Layer 1 smart contracts to confirm the correct execution of transactions after straightforward verification.

The key difference between ZK-Rollup and OP-Rollup lies in how Layer 1 validates the data uploaded from Layer 2.

In the ZK-Rollup model, Layer 1 employs smart contracts to efficiently verify the validity of ZK proofs. If the verification is successful, it implies the batch of transactions was executed correctly, and the state is updated accordingly. If the verification fails, the batch of transactions is rejected.

Contrastingly, OP-Rollup uses Layer 1 primarily as a data availability bulletin board, depending on challenger oversight, leading to significant discrepancies in security and transaction confirmation speed between the two models.

The benefits of ZK-Rollup are clear:

-   It relies on mathematics instead of validators, ensuring superior security and faster confirmation times.
-   It achieves higher compression rates, allowing for greater scalability in Layer 2.

Having gained significant knowledge, **let's now explore the practical implementation of ZK-Rollup in the testnet**.

## Footnotes and Further Reading:

<sup>[1]</sup> Succinctness in ZK-Rollup refers to the requirement that the cost of verifying a computation (i.e., verifying the zero-knowledge proof) should be much smaller than the cost of recomputing all the transactions. Its precise definition can be illustrated with the following example:

A proof, denoted as π, can be considered succinct if it satisfies the following conditions:

1. |π| = poly(λ, log|C|)
2. Verification time satisfies poly(λ, |x|, log|C|)
