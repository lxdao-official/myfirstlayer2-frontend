# 1.2 Impossibility Triangle

<ImpossibleTriangle/>

Due to the inherent characteristics of blockchain, a paradox known as the blockchain trilemma emerges. The blockchain trilemma represents the conflict between three primary goals in designing a blockchain system: decentralization, security, and scalability.

1. Decentralization: This entails ensuring that all nodes within the blockchain system possess equal power, without the presence of a single centralized authority controlling the network. Decentralization is a fundamental aspect of blockchain, serving as the foundation for system security and resistance to attacks.
2. Security: Security involves ensuring the authenticity, integrity, immutability, and resistance to attacks of transactions within the blockchain system. It is a crucial guarantee for the reliability and trustworthiness of the blockchain system.
3. Scalability: Scalability, or performance, refers to the ability of a blockchain system to support a significant number of transactions, nodes, and users. It is an essential requirement for meeting real-world demands.

These three goals often entail trade-offs. For instance, pursuing higher decentralization requires all nodes to store complete blockchain data, but this may hinder scalability. Conversely, prioritizing scalability may involve sacrificing a certain level of decentralization. For example, adopting sharding technology <sup>[1]</sup> to increase capacity may lead to challenges in data synchronization between nodes and an elevated risk of security compromises.

When designing a blockchain system, striking a balance among these goals becomes crucial. Optimizing one aspect often involves compromising performance in other areas. This poses significant challenges when attempting to address the blockchain trilemma at the Layer 1 level. Thus, the question remains: **Is there a way to circumvent the blockchain trilemma?**

## Footnotes and Further Reading:

<sup>[1]</sup> Sharding technology, which predates blockchain, has been utilized in traditional databases to enhance large-scale commercial databases. The concept involves dividing the database into multiple data shards and distributing them across different servers to prevent excessive load on a single server during high-demand requests.

In the context of blockchain, sharding technology can facilitate the handling of a large number of transactions within a short period, thereby achieving scalability. However, it also introduces new challenges, such as communication issues between different shards, information synchronization problems due to not storing all transaction records in each shard, and an increased risk of 51% attacks due to the dispersion of verification computing power. Each of these challenges requires additional mechanisms for resolution, thereby increasing the overall complexity of the consensus mechanism.
