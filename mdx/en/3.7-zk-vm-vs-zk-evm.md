# 3.7 ZK-VM vs ZK-EVM

_Note: This chapter contains a plethora of technical terms and explanations, making it quite intricate. Nonetheless, you can grasp the functioning of ZK-Rollup without delving into the technical minutiae._

&nbsp;

When evaluating the advancement of ZK-Rollup, it's worth considering its compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

## ZK-VM: A Zero-Knowledge Proof-Centric Approach

One approach is to create algorithms specifically crafted for zero-knowledge proofs, **developing a ZK-VM <sup>[1]</sup> (Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine) instead of a natively EVM-compatible ZK-EVM <sup>[2]</sup>.** The goal here is to attain EVM compatibility as closely as possible.

Both StarkWare and zkSync have embraced this method. StarkWare's Cairo language and zkSync's Zinc language are native zero-knowledge programming languages, featuring notable differences in the account address systems compared to Ethereum.

The merit of this approach lies in its capacity to leverage the potential of zero-knowledge proofs fully, thereby achieving maximum scalability. However, the downside is that developers need to learn new programming languages. Furthermore, existing projects must convert Solidity code <sup>[3]</sup> to ZK-VM code, which could introduce unforeseen issues, necessitating debugging and re-auditing.

## ZK-EVM: An EVM Compatibility-Centric Approach

Conversely, **an EVM compatibility-centric approach involves deconstructing EVM transactions into smaller steps at the opcode <sup>[4]</sup> level and identifying corresponding zero-knowledge proof algorithms for each step**, with the goal of achieving complete EVM compatibility. This approach eases the transition for developers to Layer 2 networks, with minimal disruption, and encourages the migration of existing projects while preserving the achievements of the current EVM ecosystem. Scroll and Polygon Hermez have adopted this approach.

However, the drawbacks of this approach are apparent. Since EVM transactions are not originally designed for zero-knowledge proofs, this often leads to larger proof sizes and longer processing times.

By now, we have garnered an understanding of the current progress of Rollups, particularly the intriguing aspect of zero-knowledge-proof technology, which lends Rollups substantial potential. Nonetheless, depending solely on Rollups for scalability has its constraints. **Are there other potential improvements on the horizon?**

## Footnotes and Further Reading:

<sup>[1]</sup> VM (Virtual Machine) is a software environment that emulates hardware and provides a controlled execution environment for code. ZK-VM (Zero Knowledge - Virtual Machine) is a virtual machine that's designed specifically for zero-knowledge proofs.

<sup>[2]</sup> ZK-EVM (Zero Knowledge - Ethereum Virtual Machine) is an Ethereum Virtual Machine that utilizes zero-knowledge proof technology and maintains good compatibility with the original Ethereum Virtual Machine.

<sup>[3]</sup> Solidity is Ethereum's native programming language, with most smart contracts running on the Ethereum network written in Solidity.

<sup>[4]</sup> Computers directly understand the language of 0s and 1s. Opcode (Operation Code) is a low-level code that interacts directly with hardware (or virtual hardware in a virtual machine). Each instruction in an instruction set carries a unique opcode, which serves as an identifier when the computer executes instructions.

Furthermore, here are some related concepts:

1. Instruction Set: An instruction set is a low-level language used for programming that represents a set of instructions computer hardware can understand and execute. Each processor carries its unique instruction set, which defines the basic operations the processor can carry out, such as data movement, arithmetic, logical operations, conditional branching, etc. The instruction set is also referred to as the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).

2. Bytecode: Bytecode is an intermediate code that sits between source code and machine code. Rather than being executed directly by hardware, bytecode is typically executed by a virtual machine (such as the Java Virtual Machine, JVM). The purpose of bytecode is to provide a platform-independent representation of code so that the same bytecode can be executed on different platforms by different virtual machines. Although bytecode is often closer to machine code than source code, it still requires interpretation or compilation into the specific hardware's instruction set.

An instruction set comprises fundamental operations that a computer's hardware can execute, each operation having a unique opcode. Bytecode is a platform-independent intermediate code that needs to be translated into the specific hardware's instruction set by a virtual machine during execution. In this process, the instructions in bytecode also have their respective opcodes. To sum up, an opcode is an identifier for an instruction, which is used in both instruction sets and bytecode.
