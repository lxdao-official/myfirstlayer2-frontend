# 3.1 How to Compress

Consider Optimistic Rollup (OP-Rollup) for instance, where we need to transmit all transaction details over a certain time span to Layer 1. If this data isn't significantly compressed, the effect of reducing the load on Layer 1 will be minimal. Let's use a single transaction as an example to identify potential areas for data compression.

A standard transfer transaction might include the following raw transaction data:

**4232f461**000000000000000000000000**7ea2be2df7ba6e54b1a9c70676f668455e329d29**000000000000000000000000**d548a5e31de2b4c2681a58a3be5302abcae4bc57**00000000000000000000**000000000000000000000000000000000000000186a0**

(**Method ID** / Zero padding / **Token contract address** / Zero padding / **Recipient account address** / Zero padding / **Token transfer amount**)

&nbsp;

Several strategies can be employed to compress the raw transaction data:

1. Express the transfer amount in **scientific notation** <sup>[1]</sup> as 64-bit data, removing unnecessary zeros. Although this might slightly decrease the precision of the amount, the impact is usually negligible in practice.
2. If a commonly used method is being invoked, the Method ID can be left out. For instance, transactions such as "transferring ERC20 <sup>[2]</sup> token" can be inferred based on the characteristics of the transaction content.
3. Create a shorthand (Helper ID) for frequent actions: Most token transfer actions are conducted with well-known tokens like USDC or WETH. A shorter Helper ID can be used to represent the action as "transfer" and the token as "USDC".
4. Maintain a directory of recipient addresses, transforming the 40-character addresses into the Xth address on the XXXth page.
5. If ETH is being transferred, even the Helper ID can be omitted.

As a result, the data to be uploaded to Layer 1 is reduced to:

**059c57**0186a0

（**Directory reference for the recipient account** / Token transfer amount）

**Are there further room for compression beyond the methods mentioned?**

## Footnotes and Further Reading:

<sup>[1]</sup> Scientific notation is a way of expressing numbers as a product of 'a' and 10 raised to the power of 'n' (where 1 ≤ |a| < 10, 'a' isn't a fraction, and 'n' is an integer). For instance, 19971400000000 can be represented as 1.99714 × 10<sup>13</sup>.

<sup>[2]</sup> ERC20, or Ethereum Request for Comments 20, is the 20th Ethereum Improvement Proposal. It is a common token standard that sets rules for token names, precision, and authorization limits. Tokens such as USDC, WETH, WBTC, etc., adhere to the ERC20 standard.
