# 3.1 How to Compress

Consider Optimistic Rollup (OP-Rollup) for instance, where we need to transmit all transaction details over a certain time span to Layer 1. If this data isn't significantly compressed, the effect of reducing the load on Layer 1 will be minimal. Let's use a single transaction as an example to identify potential areas for data compression.

A standard transfer transaction might include the following raw transaction data:

**4232f461**000000000000000000000000**7ea2be2df7ba6e54b1a9c70676f668455e329d29**000000000000000000000000**d548a5e31de2b4c2681a58a3be5302abcae4bc57**00000000000000000000**000000000000000000000000000000000000000186a0**

(**Method ID** / Zero padding <sup>[1]</sup> / **Token contract address** / Zero padding / **Recipient account address** / Zero padding / **Token transfer amount**)

&nbsp;

Several strategies can be employed to compress the raw transaction data:

1. Express the transfer amount in **scientific notation** <sup>[2]</sup> as 64-bit data, removing unnecessary zeros. Although this might slightly decrease the precision of the amount, the impact is usually negligible in practice.
2. If a commonly used method is being invoked, the Method ID can be left out. For instance, transactions such as "transferring ERC20 <sup>[3]</sup> token" can be inferred based on the characteristics of the transaction content.
3. Create a shorthand (Helper ID) for frequent actions: Most token transfer actions are conducted with well-known tokens like USDC or WETH. A shorter Helper ID can be used to represent the action as "transfer" and the token as "USDC".
4. Maintain a directory of recipient addresses, transforming the 40-character addresses into the Xth address on the XXXth page.
5. If ETH is being transferred, even the Helper ID can be omitted.

As a result, the data we need to upload to Layer 1 has been compressed from a very long piece of information

**4232f461**000000000000000000000000**7ea2be2df7ba6e54b1a9c70676f668455e329d29**000000000000000000000000**d548a5e31de2b4c2681a58a3be5302abcae4bc57**00000000000000000000**000000000000000000000000000000000000000186a0**

The cost of storing data on Layer 1 is very high, most of the execution cost on Layer 2 is consumed in this step, so compressing the data to be uploaded can significantly reduce the overall transaction cost of Layer 2. In addition to the above compression methods，**Are there further room for compression beyond the methods mentioned?**

## Footnotes and Further Reading:

<sup>[1]</sup> The reason for padding zero to occupy space is that the transaction data in Ethereum is encoded with fixed length, such as Method ID occupying 128 bits (32 hexadecimal letters), address and amount occupying 256 bits (64 hexadecimal letters), and information fields that are not long enough need to be filled with 0 to maintain data alignment and consistency.

<sup>[2]</sup> Scientific notation is a way of expressing numbers as a product of 'a' and 10 raised to the power of 'n' (where 1 ≤ |a| < 10, 'a' isn't a fraction, and 'n' is an integer). For instance, 19971400000000 can be represented as 1.99714 × 10<sup>13</sup>.

<sup>[3]</sup> ERC20, or Ethereum Request for Comments 20, is the 20th Ethereum Improvement Proposal. It is a common token standard that sets rules for token names, precision, and authorization limits. Tokens such as USDC, WETH, WBTC, etc., adhere to the ERC20 standard.
