# 1.1 Attempts for Improvement

Blockchain is a decentralized distributed ledger technology that uses encryption algorithms to package transaction records into blocks and link them in chronological order to form an immutable chain structure. In simple terms, it allows everyone to maintain the same ledger, achieving value immutability in an Internet where information can be replicated.

To ensure a low entry barrier for participation, Bitcoin controls the block generation time for the entire network to approximately 10 minutes, resulting in an average Transactions Per Second (TPS) <sup>[1]</sup> in the single digits. Ethereum has a block generation time of about 12 seconds, with an average TPS of only a few dozen. This falls short compared to the economic activities of traditional Web2.

## Attempts to Improve Performance

After understanding the fundamental principles of blockchain, we naturally consider the following two approaches to enhance performance:

<MdxImg src="https://cdn.myfirst.io/layer2/assets/1.1.1.gif" width="600px" alt="Bigger bLock & Faster block speed.gif" />

-   Increase the size of individual blocks to accommodate more transactions.

    This approach leads to rapid bloating of the blockchain ledger, requiring increasingly higher performance from participating validating machines, raising the entry barrier, and gradually reducing the decentralization and security of the entire network. Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which forked from Bitcoin, increased the block size from 1MB to 32MB, while Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision (BSV) even more aggressively removed the block size limit, allowing an unlimited amount of information to be incorporated into a block.

-   Decrease the block generation time and aim to generate more blocks within a certain period to process more transactions.

    This approach imposes higher requirements on the network conditions of nodes, increasing the entry barrier. It also affects the stability of data synchronization across the network because node clusters physically far apart are prone to divergent opinions on the latest blocks, leading to forks. Forked chains need to compete to produce a new longest chain, discarding one branch and resulting in the rewriting of many transactions during a certain period, known as "block reorganization". Polygon experienced 157 block reorganization events in 2023 <sup>[2]</sup>.

In addition, some public chains attempt to improve performance in more aggressive ways:

-   Using fewer supernodes for communication:

    Supernodes have higher performance and better and more stable network bandwidth, enabling ultra-fast communication between them. However, this clearly reduces decentralization. For example, Fantom has 51 consensus nodes, while Binance Smart Chain (BSC), EOS, and TRON have only 21 supernodes.

-   Using special consensus mechanisms to enhance performance:

    The consensus mechanism determines how nodes in the network reach consensus on block generation. Some special mechanisms may improve block generation speed, but the more complex the consensus mechanism, the higher the requirements for machine performance, and the easier it is for a single point of failure to cause system errors. For example, Solana relies on a single leader node randomly selected from the entire network of nodes to coordinate, achieving a theoretically high upper limit of TPS. However, it requires extremely high node performance and has experienced multiple security incidents of network-wide downtime.

The exploration achievements of high-performance public chains have generally achieved TPS increases to 100-1000, but the number of consensus nodes has been reduced to a range from 10s to over 1000. Compared to Ethereum, which has nearly 10000 distributed consensus nodes globally <sup>[3]</sup>, while high-performance public chains have improved performance by one or two orders of magnitude, decentralization has decreased by one or two orders of magnitude. So, what challenges did blockchain face when trying to improve on Layer 1 <sup>[4]</sup> ?

<sup>[1]</sup> TPS stands for Transactions Per Second, which reflects the system's processing capacity and throughput. Generally, the higher the TPS, the stronger the system's processing capacity, and the more transactions it can handle.
