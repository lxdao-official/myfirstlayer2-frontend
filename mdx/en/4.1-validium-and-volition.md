# 4.1 Validium and Volition

When reflecting on the evolution of Layer 2 scaling solutions, the pivotal role of **data availability** in influencing both security and functionality becomes apparent.

1. Sidechain solutions, where data isn't accessible on the main chain, fail to inherit the security of the main chain.
2. In Plasma solutions, while the state root can ensure the immutability of the off-chain ledger, the absence of specific transaction data on the Layer 1 network complicates fund withdrawals.
3. With OP-Rollup solutions, detailed transaction data is stored on the Layer 1 network, guaranteeing the availability of all transaction data and thereby strengthening the security of the Layer 2 network.
4. In ZK-Rollup solutions, vital transaction data and zero-knowledge proofs that verify the correct execution of off-chain transactions are provided. This balances security while maintaining a certain degree of privacy, relying on mathematical proofs rather than validators.

The merger of **zero-knowledge proofs and data availability** has led to the proposal of two promising solutions for the future: Validium and Volition, both proposed by StarkNet.

## Validium

In ZK-Rollup, transaction data is uploaded to the main network. But suppose we are willing to slightly compromise security by avoiding the upload of transaction data to Layer 1. In that case, we only need to upload the state root and zero-knowledge proofs validating the correct execution of transactions, while the Layer 2 network manages the storage of transaction data. This method, known as Validium, can further reduce transaction costs.

This approach resembles a zero-knowledge version of Plasma. Plasma necessitates user participation in overseeing honest transaction execution, but integrating zero-knowledge proofs makes generating proofs for dishonest transactions impossible, substantially increasing the challenge for nodes attempting malicious activities. Furthermore, since transaction data is entirely inaccessible to the Layer 1 network, Validium offers enhanced privacy.

## Volition

Volition is an advanced version of the Validium solution, granting users the choice of making their transaction data available on the Layer 1 network. Transactions involving substantial funds can opt for a more secure but slightly more expensive on-chain inclusion approach. Conversely, smaller transactions prioritizing privacy can use an off-chain transaction recording mode that excludes transaction data on-chain.

The following diagram will assist in better understanding the relationships between various Layer 2 solutions:

Beyond the amalgamation of data availability and zero-knowledge proofs, **are there other technologies capable of boosting Ethereum's scalability?**
