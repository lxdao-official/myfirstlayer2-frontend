# 3.6 STARK vs SNARK

_Note: This section delves deep into technical terminology and explanations and might be more difficult to comprehend. However, a thorough understanding of these underlying technical principles isn't necessary to grasp how ZK-Rollup works._

&nbsp;

## The Basic Components of ZK-Rollup

ZK-Rollup utilizes specific mathematical instruments to ensure the correct execution of transactions while concealing the original input data. It primarily incorporates the following technologies:

- KZG Polynomial Commitment: As two polynomials can have at most n<sup>2</sup> intersection points and the domain contains an abundance of points, validating a finite number of times is enough to confirm the counterparty has performed calculations with the correct polynomial. Information is encoded within the polynomial and by verifying the output results at specific points, transaction validation is ensured. The original interactive verification process can be made non-interactive through various methods.
- Hash Algorithm: This can map data of any length to a fixed-length hash value and is used for proof compression.
- Elliptic Curve Encryption: This facilitates the unpredictable mapping of two points on an elliptic curve, aiding in building a proof system. This can be used to carry out complex proofs, such as proving the equivalence of two hashes without disclosing the hash values.
- Random Numbers and Other Components: These are used for generating random numbers to determine the starting point for verification, ensuring the randomness and non-interactivity of the sequence of points to be checked through a mechanism similar to "the influence of the previous hash on the next hash".

_The diagram below is only illustrative. Two third-degree polynomials can have a maximum of 9 intersection points. Therefore, by checking just 10 points, we can be absolutely certain that the function checked is identical to the declared function. For higher-degree polynomials, selecting multiple points can also achieve a high level of confidence in the confirmation._

## SNARK

Presently, there are two primary techniques for zero-knowledge proofs: SNARK and STARK. SNARK was developed earlier and is more mature, making it the choice of many projects.

SNARK：Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge

1. Succinct: Verification speed is faster than proof generation.
2. Non-Interactive: No interaction is required between the prover and verifier. For instance, the public-private key pair used in Bitcoin is a form of zero-knowledge proof, but it requires the private key holder to sign a message to prove ownership, which involves interaction.
3. Argument: Offers statistical reliability (e.g., 99.99999999%) rather than absolute mathematical proof (100%).
4. It can encode specific information into the zero-knowledge proof, such as confirming the correct execution of a transaction.

## STARK

STARK：Scalable Transparent Argument of Knowledge

1. Scalable: Verification time stays short even when dealing with large-scale transaction proofs.
2. Transparent: Random numbers are publicly verifiable, negating the need for an initial trusted setup as required in SNARK.
3. Argument: Offers statistical reliability (e.g., 99.99999999%) rather than absolute mathematical proof (100%).
4. Knowledge: Specific information can be encoded into the zero-knowledge proof, such as confirming the correct execution of a transaction.

When comparing the two techniques, STARK has advantages when processing a large volume of transactions on Layer 2. Its faster zero-knowledge proof generation and verification speed give it an edge. Furthermore, STARK has quantum resistance <sup>[1]</sup> and doesn't require an initial trusted setup <sup>[2]</sup>, making it more secure. On the other hand, SNARK has been in development for longer and is more mature, which may lead to its earlier adoption.

SNARK produces smaller proof sizes and, with technological advancements, can utilize the initial trusted setup in upgraded versions, ensuring that its security is not significantly weaker than STARK's. The relationship between SNARK and STARK is akin to that between OP-Rollup and ZK-Rollup, with the former likely to be implemented earlier while the latter holds greater potential.

Understanding ZK-Rollup from a low-level technical viewpoint can be complex. **Is there a more straightforward way to understand ZK-Rollup?**

## Footnotes and Further Reading:

<sup>[1]</sup> Quantum resistance refers to the ability to maintain information security against potential attacks from quantum computers. Traditional encryption algorithms like RSA, DSA, and ECC may be vulnerable to large-scale quantum computers in the future. Therefore, new post-quantum cryptographic algorithms are needed to replace them and ensure secure encryption in the quantum computing era.

<sup>[2]</sup> Initial trusted setup refers to trusting the deployer to set up a secure environment honestly at the initial protocol deployment. For example, if one of the parties involved in the deployment destroys their private key, it confirms that no one has control over the initial information. The initial trusted setup is mainly related to randomness. The computation process of zero-knowledge proofs heavily depends on random inputs. However, if the initial randomness is compromised, it may lead to predictable subsequent computations, introducing security risks.
