# 3.3 Optimistic Rollup

Optimistic Rollup, also referred to as "optimistic bundling", operates under the assumption that the majority of participants are trustworthy. It uses a subset of validator nodes to collect, sequence, and validate transactions. Furthermore, it assigns a role to challengers, who are responsible for verifying the accuracy of the data submitted by validators.

On a regular basis, OP-Rollup uploads two types of data to the Ethereum mainnet:

-   State Root: The state root offers a swift verification of the content integrity of the Layer 2 ledger.
-   Compressed transaction data: This encapsulates various transaction details, including user signatures.

While the full transaction details for a recent period are uploaded, the Ethereum mainnet doesn't directly verify these transactions; it merely provides a public display.

Much like Plasma, OP-Rollup also uses a Merkle tree structure to house a "mini-ledger" that logs the entire state (account balances) of all accounts. If we trust the current transaction validators, the state root can swiftly verify whether the Layer 2 mini-ledger's content has been manipulated, thus ensuring security.

Conversely, if there are concerns about the legitimacy of current transactions, any third party can retrieve all recent transactions and validate them independently. They can then cross-verify their validated results with the Layer 2 mini-ledger's records to confirm their legality. Should any fraudulent activity be discovered, challengers can submit fraud proofs on Ethereum's Layer 1 to alter the state on Layer 2. Successful challenges penalize dishonest validators, reward challengers, and the affected transactions undergo a rollback <sup>[1]</sup> for revalidation.

In this process, the supervising challenger directly interfaces with Layer 1 smart contracts and holds the final decision-making power concerning the state between Layer 1 and Layer 2.

Under this design, even a single honest challenger is sufficient to ensure the entire Layer 2's security. However, the trade-off is that OP-Rollup must provide an exit window to grant challengers enough time to verify and submit fraud proofs, leading to a typical 7-14 day waiting period when withdrawing funds from the OP-Rollup network via the official bridge.

OP-Rollup's logic is straightforward and understandable. It uploads all transaction details, thereby ensuring high compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)<sup>[2]</sup> and easing implementation. However, the protracted challenge period may be cumbersome. **Is there a way to address this lengthy exit waiting time issue?**

## Footnotes and Further Reading:

<sup>[1]</sup> The extent of rollbacks is dependent on the specific design mechanisms of the Layer 2 solution. Some options only rollback invalid transactions, while others may declare affected blocks as orphaned and proceed from unaffected blocks, leading to a rollback of transactions over a certain period for revalidation. Alternatively, some options might employ multi-round challenges or other methods to limit the rollback scope.

<sup>[2]</sup> The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the environment where Ethereum smart contracts are executed. A virtual machine is a fully functioning computer system with complete hardware capabilities that operates in an isolated environment. Developers don't need to worry about the underlying implementation details; developing within the Ethereum Virtual Machine guarantees consistency in the execution environment.
