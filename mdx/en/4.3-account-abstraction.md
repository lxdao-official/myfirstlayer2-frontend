# 4.3 Account Abstraction and Mass Adoption

Wallets undeniably serve as the primary gateway to the Web3 ecosystem, acting as a crucial instrument for users entering the Web3 sphere. The vast majority of users interact Web3 with Externally Owned Account (EOA) <sup>[1]</sup>, which control the entire wallet through private keys and mnemonic phrases <sup>[2]</sup> (such as MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Trust Wallet). However, these accounts come with several challenges:

1. Steep Learning Curve: Users are required to comprehend complex concepts like asymmetric encryption and grasp that anyone with the private key gains full control over the account, while losing the private key results in complete loss of control over their funds.
2. Single Point of Failure: The loss or leak of a private key, or forgetting the password, leads to an irrecoverable loss of assets. Traditional recovery methods like mobile or email verification, or the use of identification documents, are not applicable.
3. Risk Management Hurdles: Numerous malicious attacks aim to steal private keys or exploit users' assets through malicious authorizations and signatures without directly stealing the private key. This requires new users to undertake extensive learning and develop careful habits to safeguard their assets.
4. Limited Smart Contract Support: EOA lack the ability to execute complex and diverse advanced functions, like multi-signature transactions or batch token transfers.

Account Abstraction essentially functions as a smart contract wallet. It abstracts certain functionalities and implementation specifics, using a series of smart contracts to emulate an "account" effect. It diverges from the fundamental principles of private key-controlled EOA accounts, allowing for alternative, more user-friendly methods to verify account ownership and offering enhanced flexibility in functionality. It addresses the following issues with existing EOA accounts:

1. Conventional Account Usage: Users can authenticate their accounts using methods similar to traditional Web2 services, such as email, mobile SMS, and two-factor authentication.
2. Improved Security Measures: In the event of security risks, account functionality can be temporarily halted, and control can be regained through mechanisms like social recovery.
3. Integration with Third-party Security Modules: Professional risk control modules can be incorporated to filter risky operations, thereby mitigating the chances of underlying level attacks.
4. Additional Smart Contract Functionality Support: Users can execute operations like multi-signature transactions, batch transfers of multiple tokens, and batch authorization of spending limits, even without programming skills.

Account abstraction also introduces several new possibilities:

1. Gas Fee Proxy: This allows third parties to pay for gas fees, with wallet operators covering gas fees to draw in users. Wallets act as commercial entry points, offering users more affordable services.
2. Conditional Transactions: These transactions are automatically executed when specific conditions are met.
3. Cross-chain Operations: Enables seamless interaction with cross-chain bridge smart contracts, promoting flexible asset cross-chain transfers and other cross-chain activities.
4. Expanded DeFi Scenarios: Account abstraction opens new possibilities for DeFi, like batch transactions, automated lending, liquidity mining, and more.

Account abstraction significantly broadens Ethereum's potential. However, a drawback of account abstraction is that all transactions are based on smart contracts, leading to higher gas costs and making it prohibitively expensive on the Ethereum mainnet.

As an execution layer, Layer 2 naturally accommodates account abstraction, with users remaining oblivious to private keys or even the existence of gas fees. Smart contract wallets themselves are capable of integrating third-party services for risk control, making transfers and interactions more secure and facilitating a broader range of business scenarios. It can be argued that the future widespread application of blockchain technology heavily depends on account abstraction, which in turn necessitates lower-cost Layer 2 solutions to be feasible.

## Footnotes and Further Reading:

<sup>[1]</sup> EOA, or Externally Owned Accounts, refers to accounts owned and controlled by private keys, in contrast to Contract Accounts.

<sup>[2]</sup> A mnemonic phrase, also known as a seed phrase, is derived from a private key. While private keys are random numbers that are challenging to remember, mnemonic phrases, based on the BIP-39 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39) standard, convert private keys into a sequence of words (typically 12, 15, 18, or 24 words), which are easier for humans to memorize.
